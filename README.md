# Ultraviolet_Catastrophe
1. Who is this for?
   Students learning thermal radiation or blackbody radiation who are confused about the ultraviolet catastrophe.

2. What problem does it solve?
   Textbooks often state that the Rayleigh–Jeans law ‘diverges’ without showing how or why this leads to a physical contradiction.

3. What should the reader learn?
   By interacting with this model, the reader should understand where classical reasoning breaks down and why quantisation resolves it.

4. What is intentionally simplified?
   This model ignores material-dependent emissivity and focuses only on ideal blackbody behaviour.
